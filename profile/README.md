## Who are we?
We are a student led club at the University of Luxembourg, made up of passionate computer science students who wish to become better software engineers and team-players via building/contributing to open-source projects!

Our goal is to develop best practices for software engineering and overall project management while celebrating the great medium of open-source.

## What are we doing right now?
We are currently working on the [BICS-BOT](https://github.com/Luxembourg-Open-Source-Club/BICS-BOT). It is a Discord bot written in Python that is made BICS students to organize the student Discord server.
