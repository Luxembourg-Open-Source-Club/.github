### Who are we?
We are a student led club at the University of Luxembourg, made up of passionate computer science students who wish to become better software engineers and team-players via building/contributing to open-source projects!

Our goal is to develop best practices for software engineering and overall project management while celebrating the great medium of open-source.

### What are we doing right now?
We are currently working on the [BICS-BOT](https://github.com/Luxembourg-Open-Source-Club/BICS-BOT). It is a Discord bot written in Python that is made for universities to organize studies. It is intended to be used on, for example; a Discord server for the _Bachelor in Computer Science_ students in the University of Luxembourg :)

### How can you be a part of this club?
It's very simple. You can join our [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/Ya7Xft2dHx) to stay up-to-date with all organizational news. There you can find:
- Where and when we meet.
- How we work as a team.
- How to use our collective resources.
